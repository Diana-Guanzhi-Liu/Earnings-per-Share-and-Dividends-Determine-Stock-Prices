Companies with Higher Earnings per Share are More Attractive to Investors
From model 1, we obtain an intercept of 27.25 meaning that when EPS is zero, stock price is 27.35 USD. This term has standard error of 11.47USD which means that the estimate is not very precise as it usually deviates from the real stock price by 11.47. We also obtain a coefficient of 26.59 with standard error of 1.05 for EPS, indicating that for every additional dollar increase in EPS, stock price increases by 26.599 USD (@tbl-modelresults). The standard error is relatively small, just over a dollar, so model 1 is reasonably accurate for predicting stock price using. This confirms that there is a positive linear relationship between EPS and stock price. When a company is profitable relative to the amount of shares they have, each shareholder is entitle to a larger portion of their profit, making the company a more attractive investment than competitors that have lower EPS. This demand for shares of the company then drives up stock prices. Alternatively, a lower EPS indicating lower profitability or losses can cause existing shareholders to sell their shares, creating downward pressure on price.

This conclusion has several implications for investors and management of companies alike. For investors, it may be useful to use the causal relationship between EPS and stock price to predict future stock prices. An investor can use available net income information and number of shares from any company to calculate EPS before the information is released to the public. If the estimated EPS is high, the investor can buy up shares at a lower price before the increase in demand and sell those shares once demand increases to make a profit.

Managers of a company who have an incentive for their company to be profitable in the long term would want their share prices to exhibit stable growth over time instead of the short term fluctuations caused by changing demand. If managers anticipates that one year's EPS will be low, the company can use excess income to buy up shares once the price decreases. This alleviates some of the downward pressure on price and creates more stability. The company can then either hold onto the purchased share until a subsequent year when the price rebounds to sell them, or eliminate those shares from the market. Fewer shares means that the denominator of the EPS equation is smaller, causing subsequent EPS to be higher in the future.

## Paying Dividends Causes Stock Prices to Fall
From @fig-boxplot there is a negative relationship between paying dividends and stock price. When a company chooses to pay dividends, on average their stock price is expected to decrease by about 177.85 USD (@tbl-modelresults). This is consistent with contemporary literature on dividend policy which suggests that paying dividends causes the stock price to drop by the amount of the dividend per share plus the opportunity cost of lost potential profits the dividend could have been used to generate [@CiteNarinderp]. Dividends paid out represents value that is extracted from the company and not used to invest into profitable projects. All things equal, this indicates that the company is expected to grow less than competitors who did not pay dividends and reinvested, making the stock less attractive to investors who care about growth.

EPS coefficient of companies that paid dividends is 25.59 which is one dollar less than that of model one where dividends were not considered (@tbl-modelresults). This means that the amount price is expected to increase per dollar EPS increases is smaller, likely due to the negative stock price effect of dividends interacting with the positive effect of EPS. Since the EPS coefficient is only reduced by a dollar, we can assume that the positive EPS effect is stronger than that of the dividends.

These results can be useful for managers who are faced with the decision of what to do with extra profit. If paid out in dividends, the stock price will fall, but existing shareholders, especially large ones with 10% or more equity in the company, would want the dividend income as compensation for their investment and push management to pay dividends. At the same time, paying out dividends makes the stock less attractive to future investors. By knowing the coefficient of paying dividends and how it effects the EPS coefficient, managers are better able to balance these competing priorities and make better decisions in regards to long-term profitability and growth of their firms.

Investors can use these results to secure profit opportunities. If a company announces that they will pay dividends, investors can anticipate the decline in stock price and react accordingly, either buying the stock to receive the dividend or selling and locking in returns before the price drops. How paying dividends decrease the positive effect on price EPS has can also be used to their advantage. Based on EPS and dividends information which are publicly available, investors can more accurately predict the future stock price of any given company and make a profit by buying or selling its stocks.

## Weaknesses and next steps
A weakness in our model is the distribution of the data where they are clustered around zero, this may indicate that a linear model is not appropriate for our observations and the conclusions between EPS, dividends and price cannot be drawn. While the residuals follow normal distribution, they are clustered together instead of randomly spaced apart, indicating that they contain some additional structure that was not captured by our analysis (@fig-residuals). The posterior prediction check also supports this as the actual data is far larger kurtosis than what the model predicted, meaning that the predictive power of the model is low (@fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-1). The credibility intervals for the coefficient of paying dividends is also quite large, with probability normally distributed between about -275 and -125 USD, suggesting a relatively high level of uncertainty (@fig-credible-intervals). Practically, the model worked as intended with no signs of problems from the trace plot or r-hat values (@fig-trace-rhat). Further work is needed to confirm the positive linear relationship between stock price and EPS, as well as how paying dividends affect this relationship.

The conclusions drawn from our analysis only applies to our data set of large, North American companies from 2013-2023. More analysis with diverse data sets need to be done to determine if the same conclusions are applicable to companies of different sizes or different geographic locations. The data is also historic, meaning that the relationships described may not hold in the future. Extraneous events like the pandemic are likely to effect the relationships studied in ways that cannot be predicted by our model [@CiteBasunoy].

Lastly, while financial metrics are important to management and investor decision making, there are many qualitative factors that should also be considered like the strategic direction of a firm, the strength of its customer relations and workforce productivity, and its competitive advantage within the industry. The WRDS database we used did not have metrics to measure these variables in terms of numerical value, so ways to quantify these variables should be explored. Future analysis should aim to determine the relationship between these categorical variables with stock price as well as how they interact with other financial metrics like EPS and dividends.

The analysis indicates a positive linear relationship between Earnings per Share (EPS) and stock price, suggesting that companies with higher EPS are more attractive to investors. This relationship allows investors to predict future stock prices based on EPS data before it's publicly released, providing opportunities for profit. However, paying dividends is associated with a decrease in stock price, likely due to the perceived decrease in growth potential when profits are distributed rather than reinvested. Managers facing the decision of dividend payout must balance the desires of existing shareholders for income against the potential negative impact on future investor attraction. Nonetheless, the model's weaknesses, such as clustered data distribution and high uncertainty in dividend coefficient estimates, suggest the need for further analysis and exploration of qualitative factors beyond financial metrics to better understand stock price dynamics. Overall, while EPS remains a significant predictor of stock price, future studies should aim to incorporate a broader range of variables and datasets to enhance predictive accuracy and account for potential variations across industries and time periods.

Public companies whose stock are traded on exchanges, must disclose certain financial metrics in their quarterly and yearly financial statements. Investors can then use these metrics to help inform their decision when selecting companies to invest in, their investment of buying shares represent a fractional ownership of the company. Some of the most important metrics investors look at are Net Income, Earnings Per Share (EPS), and Dividends [@CiteShakespeare]. In the data section, we discuss how EPS is a general measure of a firm's profitability, dividends are cash distributed to investors, and stock prices are determined by both the intrinsic value of the firm as well as market pressures like demand for the stock. Our estimand is the relationship between EPS and stock price as well has how this relationship is effected by dividends.

In the model section, we construct two models with model 1 being a simple linear model between EPS and stock price to determine their relationship, and model 2 being a multivariable model that groups companies by those who paid dividends and those who did not. From the results section, model 1 found that there is a positive linear relationship between EPS and stock price with every dollar increase in EPS correlating with a 26.59 USD increase in stock price. We also determined that there is a negative relationship between paying dividends and stock price. In Model 2, if the company paid dividends, every dollar increase in EPS correlates with only a 25.59 USD increase in stock price.

We have determined that there is a positive linear relationship between EPS and stock price, and a negative relationship between dividends and stock price which reduces the affect of EPS on price. These relationships can be used by investors to predict stock price of a given company based on EPS and dividends. The investor can then earn money by trading stocks accordingly, buying when the price is predicted to increase and selling when it will fall. Managers of companies can also use our results to make more informed decisions, balancing the objectives of pleasing current shareholders, investing excess income into promising projects, and maintaining the attractiveness of their stock for new investors. Further analysis should be conducted using a more diverse data set in terms of geography and company size in order to confirm these relationships for all companies. Another weakness is that stock price is also influenced by categorical factors like a company's strategic direction and competitive advantage which are variables that could not be included in our analysis. Future efforts should attempt to determine the effects of these categorical variables on stock price and how it interacts with that of EPS and dividends.  Combine this introduction with the above discussion and create an abstract.  The abstract answers: 1) what was done, 2) what was found, and 3) why this matters (all at a high level). Likely four sentences. Abstract must make clear what we learn about the world because of this paper.

This paper investigates the relationship between Earnings per Share (EPS), dividends, and stock prices in publicly traded companies. Two models were constructed: a simple linear model examining the relationship between EPS and stock price, and a multivariable model considering the impact of dividend payments on this relationship. The findings reveal a positive linear association between EPS and stock price, with every dollar increase in EPS corresponding to a $26.59 increase in stock price. Conversely, paying dividends is associated with a decrease in stock price, thereby reducing the effect of EPS on price. These insights enable investors to predict stock prices based on EPS and dividend data, facilitating informed investment decisions. Additionally, managers can utilize these results to balance shareholder interests, investment decisions, and stock attractiveness. Further research with diverse datasets is recommended to confirm these relationships across various company types and geographical regions, while future studies should explore the impact of qualitative factors on stock price dynamics. Ultimately, this study contributes to our understanding of the factors influencing stock prices and provides practical implications for investors and company management.
